<h1>History of Social Networking</h1>
<p>It’s conception would begin with BBS (bulletin board system) but that was mostly used for illicit or illegal practices in the late 70s. The next incarnation would also set the course for instant messaging, and chat rooms would see a rise with Internet Relay Chat and ICQ. Profiling on sites would soon follow with early dating websites, online accounts, and friending people; the most popular of these being MySpace starting in 2003. MySpace would explode with over 75.9 million users at its peak in 2008. Facebook would be another modern social media that can be seen today, originally starting as a Harvard-only network in 2004. It would then expand to other schools, then businesses, until eventually being accessible to everyone. Youtube would also be launched the next year and soon become the biggest video sharing platform on the web. MMOs (Massive-Multiplayer Online games) would also play a huge part of its own in online interaction, as well as a gaming genre. World of Warcraft, released in 2004, was one of the first most profitable MMOs, and is still releasing new content with Blizzard’s latest expansion, “Battle for Azeroth” on August 14th, 2018. Reddit would hit the internet at the same time as Youtube in 2005, allowing users to use the same system as previous sites, such as Digg, to upvote or downvote popular content. From there, social media still used today would continue to spawn. Twitter would serve as a way for users to follow influential people, such as celebrities or their friends. Tumblr would allow people to “micro-blog” their lives by posting screenshots, videos, and liking other posts. Smartphones would then allow for constant updates by giving users access to the internet wherever they may be. Some of the most popular and well known Social Media Networks today would be Twitter, Youtube, Snapchat, and Instagram.</p>
